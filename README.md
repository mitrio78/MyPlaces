# MyPlaces
This application allows you to save yor favourite places. I've made it as a tutorial. The main purposes were: to explore UITableViewController potential, to learn how to use camera in app to add photos, to explore how to use DataBase to store in-app data.
Main features:
* UITableViewController - based UI.
* add favourite places(Name, Location, Type of place and Photo).
* use camera/gallery to upload image to New Place.
* app is using Realm DB to store data.
* uses MapKit to get address of place
* uses map to get user's location
* renders routes from user's location to saved place
